#Ambience
**for minetest!**

## What does this cover?
Ambience will provide easy to use hooks to play ambience and music at random intervals based on the surrounding area.

## What features will be coming?
* The ability to add your own sounds and music, using a simple syntax.
* A soundtrack created by [Blackavar](https://musescore.com/blackavar/)

## Why not use another ambience mod?
The last ambience mod I tried had a few crash bugs, was messy, and I felt needed a rewrite.
