Music is defined as any track meant to be more than a few seconds long and
will be the only music playing.
A Sound is defined as a short snippet (examples include some chirping birds)

Any file found in $WORLDPATH/ambience_music/config will be assumed to be a
config file for music, the same applies to $WORLDPATH/ambience_sound for sound
configs. This allows Game authors and Server operators to easily add or adjust
sounds.

Config files are written as json, with each block referring to a single track.
The "file" field is required and must be filled with the name (minus
extension) of the audio file to be played. The "name" field can be provided
for a more nicely formatted name of the track ( "High by Blackavar" as opposed
    to "high")

The "conditions" field is required and is filled with an array of objects
containing the conditions. All conditions must be filled before the sound
will play. conditions are required to have the field "type" detailing the type
of requirement (e.g. "biome") as well as a "val" field containing the
triggering value. Certain conditions (such as "posX") require a third field
named "operation" dictating if "val" is to be interpreted as "Trigger if less
than val" or "trigger if greater than." If "Val2" is set, the trigger will be
defined as "between val and val2," such as with the "time" condition.
The available conditions are as follows:

biome_id, biome_heat, biome_humidity:
Determined by the position of the player. Note that biome_id has a few
"special" cases due to oddities. i.e. "ocean" refers to *any* ocean biome, and
"forest" refers to deciduous and coniferous forests.

posX, posY, posZ:
These compare the player's position in their respective co-ordinates

time:
Compares the current time to val and val2

canSeeSky:
Can the player see the sky
